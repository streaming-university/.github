# Streaming University :mortar_board: :computer: :tv:
Multimedia streaming research group at Ozyegin University from Istanbul, Turkey. We focus on low-latency live streaming and 360-degree video streaming.

## Supervisor: Ali C. Begen

Ali C. Begen is currently a computer science professor at Ozyegin University and a technical consultant in Comcast's Advanced Technology and Standards Group. Previously, he was a research and development engineer at Cisco. Begen received his PhD in electrical and computer engineering from Georgia Tech in 2006. To date, he received several academic and industry awards (including an Emmy® Award for Technology and Engineering), and was granted 30+ US patents. In 2020 and 2021, he was listed among the world's most influential scientists in the subfield of networking and telecommunications. More details are at https://ali.begen.net.
